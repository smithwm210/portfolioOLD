# smithwm210

Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at WPI with a passion for game design. So far, I have finished two games, in collaborations with other WPI students. My main focus of study is Computer Science, so I have plenty of experience writing code, but I'm interested in all aspects of game development.

[Apocalypse: Green Wave](https://smithwm210.github.io/green-wave/Releases-builds/index.html)

Based off of a simplified version of the Donkey Kong arcade game, Mai (pdo@wpi.edu), Aidan (afbryar@wpi.edu) and I collaborated on this project. Most of the art is from Mai, Aidan and I wrote the code, I made the music, and the final level design was by myself and Mai.

[Slid Not Stirred](https://smithwm210.github.io/slid-not-stirred/Releases-builds/index.html)

The winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop! As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, poorly translated subtitles, a "mute" button and more! Jacob Antepli (JacobAntepli) was the lead programmer and designer, William Smith (smithwm210) contributed with programming and level design, and Sarah Bodkin (s-bod) and Zack Adams (zadams111) were the lead artists.
