# smithwm210

Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design. So far, I have finished two games in collaborations with other WPI students. My main focus of study is Computer Science, so I have plenty of experience writing code, but I'm interested in all aspects of game development.

[Apocalypse: Green Wave](https://smithwm210.github.io/green-wave/Releases-builds/index.html)

Based off of a simplified version of the Donkey Kong arcade game, Phuong Mai Do (pdo@wpi.edu), Aidan Bryar (afbryar@wpi.edu) and I collaborated on this project. Most of the art is from Mai, Aidan and I wrote the code, I made the music, and the final level design was by myself and Mai.

[Slid Not Stirred](https://smithwm210.github.io/slid-not-stirred/Releases-builds/index.html)

The winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop! As part of the Game Jam, we were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, poorly translated subtitles, a prominent MS Paint animation, and more! Jacob Antepli (jaantepli@wpi.edu) was the lead programmer and designer, I contributed with programming and level design, and Sarah Bodkin (sbodkin@wpi.edu) and Zach Adams (zadams@wpi.edu) were the lead artists.
