Hello! I am a student at WPI with a passion for game design. So far, I have one finished game which was completed as a class project. My main focus of study is Computer Science, so I have plenty of experience writing code, but I'm interested in all aspects of game development.

[Apocalypse: Green Wave](https://smithwm210.github.io/green-wave/Releases-builds/index.html)

Based off of a simplified version of the Donkey Kong arcade game, Mai (PMDmaido), Aidan (Afblank1) and I created this game. Most of the art is from Mai, Aidan and I wrote the code, I made the music, and the final level design was by myself and Mai.
